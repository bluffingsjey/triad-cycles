            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <br/>
            <p><small>The triad is composed of three brothers passionate about the sport of mountain bikes. Although new to the industry of bike business, the brothers were usually on local trails, meeting friends, talking about bikes and sick of bike upgraditis. They’re usually shredding the trails of San Mateo Rizal during weekends, testing new rigs, components and savoring brunch at Pestano after a long ride. It is just with so much passion for riding that the brothers decided to bring in unique brands of mountain bikes, bikes that are raced and enjoyed globally. They began creating a business that they don’t consider as work but play.</small></p>
            <br/>
            <p><small>The brothers are in different lines of business; from their dad’s beginnings they are also managing a 3,500 SQM 5 star automotive repair shop near the known auto hub of the Philippines, Banawe Street. They are also into importation and distribution of auto parts and medical devices all over Metro Manila. Distribution, Sales and Service has been in their life blood ever since the beginning, which is why a good foundation has been created with the brothers, doing what they do best together in whatever they venture in.</small></p> 
            <br/>
            <p><small>The showroom/warehouse/demo house is located at #14 Quezon Avenue, Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines. It is an 800+ square meter showroom/warehouse with wood ramps at the warehouse for test riding of the displayed bikes at the showroom. We encourage you experience the bikes before you decide.</small></p>
